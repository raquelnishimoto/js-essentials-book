// What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee');

/*
Invoking the function "scream" on line 7 will return the result of concatenating two strings:
the value assigned to the variable "words" and the string "!!!!", in this case, "Yipeee !!!!"
But it will not print out anything on the console
