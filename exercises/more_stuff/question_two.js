/*
The stack trace indicates that there was an error when passing greeting as an argument to console.log.
`greeting` is a variable and it was not declared within scope of console.log() in the fuction hello
Perhaps the intention was to pass greeting as a string, if not then we should have declare it as a parameter of the function first before passing it down.
